# üß™ Testing Guide - Email Manager Pro

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Node.js installed (you have v22.18.0)
- ‚úÖ npm installed (you have v9.6.4)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed (npm install) ‚úì
- ‚úÖ ngrok installed ‚úì
- ‚úÖ Microsoft 365 account with Outlook access

---

## üöÄ FASTEST METHOD: Using ngrok (Recommended)

### Step 1: Start Local Server

Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**:

```bash
cd "D:\R1\Outlook Plugin"
npm start
```

You should see:
```
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8000
  http://192.168.x.x:8000
```

‚úÖ **Leave this terminal OPEN** (server must keep running)

---

### Step 2: Start ngrok Tunnel

Open a **SECOND Command Prompt/PowerShell**:

```bash
cd "D:\R1\Outlook Plugin"
ngrok http 8000
```

You'll see output like:
```
Session Status                online
Forwarding                    https://abc123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8000
```

‚úÖ **Copy the HTTPS URL** (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Keep this terminal open too! If you close it, the URL stops working.

---

### Step 3: Update manifest.xml

Open a **THIRD Command Prompt/PowerShell**:

```bash
cd "D:\R1\Outlook Plugin"
node update-manifest.js https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app
```

Replace `YOUR-NGROK-URL` with the URL from Step 2.

Example:
```bash
node update-manifest.js https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! manifest.xml has been updated
```

### Step 4: Install Add-in in Outlook Web

---

### Step 5: Test the Add-in

## üé® Customization (Optional)

Before testing, you can customize the projects:

### Quick Customization

Edit `config.js` (line 18-34) with your actual projects:

```javascript
projects: [
    { code: "YOUR-PROJECT", name: "Your Project Name", active: true },
    { code: "ANOTHER-PROJECT", name: "Another Project", active: true },
    // Add your company's projects here
]
```

**Note**: You'll also need to update:
- `taskpane.html` (lines 211-237) - Add dropdown options
- `taskpane.js` (lines 133-146) - Add to project mapping

Or just test with the default projects first!

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Add-in doesn't appear in Outlook
- Wait 2-3 minutes after installation
- Hard refresh: Press Ctrl + Shift + R
- Clear browser cache
- Make sure both servers (npm start and ngrok) are still running

### "Can't load add-in" error
- Check that ngrok is still running
- Verify the ngrok URL in manifest.xml is correct
- Check the browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure you're using the HTTPS URL from ngrok, not HTTP

### ngrok URL changed
- ngrok generates a new URL each time you restart it
- You'll need to:
  1. Copy the new URL
  2. Run `node update-manifest.js [NEW-URL]` again
  3. Uninstall the old add-in from Outlook
  4. Reinstall with the updated manifest.xml

**Tip**: Get a free ngrok account at https://ngrok.com to get a permanent URL

### Preview not updating
- Make sure you've selected both a project AND email type
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors

### Template not applying
- Ensure you're composing a NEW email (not reply/forward)
- Check that both dropdowns have selections
- Look in browser console for errors
